West Michigan R Users Group Code and Materials
==============================================

These materials are my contributions to the [West Michigan R Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/West-Michigan-R-Users-Group/) meetups. [Click here](https://github.com/pegeler/WMRUG) for the GitHub repos. See the [main WMRUG github account](https://github.com/WestMichiganRUserGroup) for more code and presentations.

--------

### Rcpp
#### March 2018
Introduces basic concepts of `C++` programming and the [`Rcpp`](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp) API for writing high-performance `C++` code in R. Also points to the use-case of the [`mvrt`](https://github.com/pegeler/mvrt) package which uses the [`Armadillo`](https://github.com/conradsnicta/armadillo) `C++` linear algebra library (via [`RcppArmadillo`](https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo)) to extend the functionality of `Rcpp`. This also touches on some of the considerations that need to be made when developing packages which include compiled code.

### Mapping 
#### March 2017 *and* October 2017
This demonstrated the mapping capabilities of R using several packages. User-friendly packages such as [`chloroplethr`](https://github.com/trulia/choroplethr) and [`ggmap`](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap) are discussed, as well as low-level mapping using shapefiles and other geographic data provided by government agencies.

### Packages
#### June 2017
Introduces the basics of creating your own package using friendly RStudio tools and packages. The [`devtools`](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools) and [`roxygen2`](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen) packages are featured prominently.

### Machine Learning 
#### August 2016
This was an overview of using various statistical modeling and algorithmic techniques to predict credit defaults. The different methods were compared using ROC curves. There is also a small primer on PCA.
