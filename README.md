==============================================

These materials were used in the West Michigan R Users Group meetups.

Contents
--------

### Rcpp
#### March 2018
Introduces basic concepts of `C++` programming and the [`Rcpp`](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp) API for writing high-performance `C++` code in R. Also points to the use-case of the [`mvrt`](https://github.com/pegeler/mvrt) package which uses the [`Armadillo`](https://github.com/conradsnicta/armadillo) `C++` linear algebra library (via [`RcppArmadillo`](https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo)) to extend the functionality of `Rcpp`. This also touches on some of the considerations that need to be made when developing packages which include compiled code.

### Mapping 
#### March 2017 *and* October 2017
This demonstrated the mapping capabilities of R using several packages. User-friendly packages such as [`chloroplethr`](https://github.com/trulia/choroplethr) and [`ggmap`](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap) are discussed, as well as low-level mapping using shapefiles and other geographic data provided by government agencies.
